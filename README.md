# RESTy

RESTy is a web app that will eventually analyze HTTP requests as they are sent to the URL entered by the user and will return a well formatted analysis of the response in the display area.

## Functionality at Phase 1

```npm start``` will load the development version front end of the project

Users can enter a URL and the HTTP method they desire by clicking the associated radio button. When the user clicks the "Go" button, their selected method and URL entered will appear below in the display area.
